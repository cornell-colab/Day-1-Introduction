# Day 1: Introduction

### Before the Session

Choose one or two of the Major Projects listed below, and one or two of the Summer Fellow Alums projects.

##### For your chosen projects,
 
1. Interact with the site and its tool(s) until you have a good feeling for the project’s scope, goals, and capabilities.
2. Read any associated “About” information to get a sense of the who the project’s creators are (and how many of them there are), what tools were used in the creation, what its data sources are, and any sources of funding.
 
##### A few questions you might want to consider:
* Who is the intended audience? Scholarly researchers, students, general public, a combination?
* Would this project be a useful tool for research, for teaching, for both? How might it be used to generate new research questions -- or answers?
* What scholarly decisions were made in the design of underlying dataset, the metadata, the visualization, and/or the user interface?
* If the underlying data is still being compiled, how is it being compiled? Are the creators using crowdsourcing or public engagement methods for collecting data?
* Are the project’s creator(s) writing (or have they already written) published works derived from their digital project?
* Do the creators offer their data or code for reuse by others?
* In what ways do find the project successful or unsuccessful?
* What are your questions?

(We'll continue to refer to the project examples in this list over the next few weeks.)
